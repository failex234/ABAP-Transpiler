# ABAP-Transpiler
A very simple WIP JavaScript to ABAP Transpiler written in Python.

Yes, a very strange idea but why not?

# About
I wanted to see if I can build a transpiler for ABAP because I hate it and you should be able to write your program in JavaScript (or any other language) and then just transpile it so you don't have to write the ABAP itself. I have chosen Python because I wanted to get better at it.

# Disclaimer
This is a very noob-like attempt at a transpiler (compiler) and it is probably not not anything you would do. But I'm very unexperienced in the area of compilers and this is just how I do it right now!
